## Overveiw of Our Method

![Illustration](./images/overview.png)
> Boosting is a method that ensembles weak-learners, which are low-performance models, to construct a strong-learner.
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often strong-learners capable of adequately learning training data, making them generally incompatible with Boosting.
Therefore, we explore a method that intentionally weakens the learning capability of DNNs and utilizes them as weak-learners.
We conduct experimental evaluations using various parameters and datasets and discuss theoretical and practical challenges.
